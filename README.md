Titanic-death-count- Machine learning project for predicting the number of deaths on Titanic dataset using linear regression,scikit learn. #Team J.A.R.V.I.S.

Problem Statement: The majestic titanic just drowned killing hundreds of lives onboard. A huge tragedy dawned upon the family members of the victims. Because of this, the government issued a compensation fund of $50,000 to the family members of dead victims. Since a lot of victims are lost in the sea, so, the actual number of dead victims is not available to the government. You Being a government official, is assigned to the job of predicting the number of dead and alive victims as accurate as possible for the compensation fund.

The dataset of the victims with their properties like Name, Travelling Class, Age, etc are provided. Train the machine learning model using train.csv and test it against the test.csv file. The Survived column of test.csv have 2 values as 1 (Alive) and 0 (Dead).
